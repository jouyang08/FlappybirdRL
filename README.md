# FlappyBirdRL 🎮🤖
## Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that Masters Flappy Bird

This project implements a complete Deep Q-Network (DQN) system that learns to play Flappy Bird from scratch through reinforcement learning. Starting with no knowledge of the game, our AI agent trains through trial and error to achieve expert-level performance, consistently scoring 20+ points.

**Mathematical Foundation**: Implements core RL algorithms including Q-learning, experience replay, target networks, and epsilon-greedy exploration with rigorous mathematical backing.

**Complete System**: Full training pipeline with progress visualization, model persistence, and interactive demo modes.

## Key Features ✨
- **Custom Flappy Bird Environment**: Pygame-based game with realistic physics
- **DQN Agent**: Deep Q-Network with experience replay and target network  
- **Expert Performance**: Trained models achieve 20+ scores consistently
- **Interactive Training**: Real-time visualization of learning progress

## Mathematical Foundation 📊

### Deep Q-Network (DQN) Algorithm

Our agent learns through the **Bellman Equation** for optimal action-value function:

## Advanced Concepts 🧠

### Why DQN Works for Flappy Bird

**Temporal Credit Assignment**: The +10 reward for passing pipes teaches the agent that specific jump timings lead to success, even when the reward comes several steps after the crucial decision.

**Function Approximation**: The neural network generalizes across similar game states, allowing the agent to handle the continuous state space of bird positions and pipe configurations.

**Experience Replay**: By training on random samples from past experiences, the agent learns from both successes and failures without being biased by recent events.

### Theoretical Foundations

This implementation demonstrates key concepts from:

- **Sutton & Barto**: Reinforcement Learning principles
- **Mnih et al. (2015)**: DQN algorithm and experience replay
- **Bellman (1957)**: Dynamic programming and optimal decision making
- **Watkins (1989)**: Q-learning temporal difference method

### Extension Possibilities

**Multi-Agent**: Train multiple birds simultaneously with shared or separate networks
**Curriculum Learning**: Start with slower pipes, gradually increase difficulty  
**Transfer Learning**: Use trained weights as starting point for related games
**Policy Gradient**: Compare with REINFORCE or Actor-Critic methods
**Competitive**: Train agents to compete against each other

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Training appears stuck at low scores**:
- Increase epsilon decay (slower exploration reduction)
- Verify reward function is working correctly
- Check if target network updates are too frequent

**Agent performs well in training but poorly in demo**:
- Ensure epsilon is set to 0 during evaluation
- Verify model loading is successful
- Check for differences in environment between training/testing

**Game window doesn't appear**:
- Ensure pygame is properly installed
- Check display capabilities (some remote systems lack GUI)
- Verify no conflicting graphics processes

**Memory issues during training**:
- Reduce replay buffer size
- Use smaller batch sizes
- Consider gradient checkpointing for large networks

### Performance Optimization

**Faster Training**:
- Disable rendering during training (set show_every to large number)
- Use GPU acceleration with CUDA if available
- Vectorize environment for parallel training

**Better Results**:
- Tune hyperparameters systematically
- Add batch normalization to neural network
- Implement prioritized experience replay
- Use double DQN or dueling DQN variants

**🎮 Ready to watch AI master Flappy Bird? Run `python train.py` and choose option 2 to see our trained agent achieve 20+ scores consistently! 🏆**

Where:
- `Q*(s,a)` = Optimal action-value function  
- `R(s,a)` = Immediate reward for action `a` in state `s`
- `γ` = Discount factor (0.99) - how much we value future rewards
- `s'` = Next state after taking action `a`
- `E[·]` = Expected value

### Neural Network Approximation

Since Flappy Bird has continuous state space, we approximate Q-values using a neural network:

```
Q(s,a; θ) ≈ Q*(s,a)
```

Where `θ` represents the network parameters (weights and biases).

### Policy (π) - Decision Making

The agent's policy π(s) determines actions using **epsilon-greedy strategy**:

```
π(s) = {
    argmax Q(s,a; θ)     with probability 1-ε  (exploitation)
       a
    random action        with probability ε     (exploration)  
}
```

- `ε` starts at 1.0 (pure exploration) and decays to 0.01 (mostly exploitation)
- `ε = max(0.01, ε × 0.995)` after each episode

### Loss Function for Training

The neural network minimizes **Mean Squared Error** between predicted and target Q-values:

```
L(θ) = E[(y_i - Q(s_i, a_i; θ))²]
```

Where the target `y_i` is computed using the **target network**:

```
y_i = R_i + γ · max Q(s'_i, a'; θ⁻) 
                 a'
```

- `θ⁻` = Target network parameters (updated every 1000 steps)
- This prevents the "moving target" problem in Q-learning

### Experience Replay

To break correlation between consecutive experiences, we sample random batches from replay buffer:

```
D = {(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})_i}_{i=1}^N
```

Training samples `B` random experiences from `D` to compute loss `L(θ)`.

### State Representation (6D Feature Vector)

Our state vector `s ∈ ℝ⁶` captures all relevant game information:

```
s = [y_bird, v_bird, d_h, d_v, d_top, d_bottom]
```

Where:
1. `y_bird` ∈ [0,1]: Bird's vertical position (normalized by screen height)
2. `v_bird` ∈ [-1,1]: Bird's vertical velocity (normalized)  
3. `d_h` ∈ [0,1]: Horizontal distance to next pipe (normalized)
4. `d_v` ∈ [-1,1]: Vertical distance to pipe gap center (normalized)
5. `d_top` ∈ [0,1]: Distance to pipe top (normalized)
6. `d_bottom` ∈ [0,1]: Distance to pipe bottom (normalized)

### Action Space

Binary action space `A = {0, 1}`:
- `a = 0`: Do nothing (gravity applies: `v_bird += gravity`)
- `a = 1`: Jump (apply upward velocity: `v_bird = jump_strength`)

### Reward Function

Carefully designed reward signal `R(s,a,s')` to encourage optimal behavior:

```
R(s,a,s') = {
    +10.0    if pipe passed (score increased)
    -100.0   if collision or out of bounds  
    +0.1     otherwise (staying alive bonus)
}
```

This creates a sparse but meaningful reward signal that encourages both survival and progress.

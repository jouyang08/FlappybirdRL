Author: Jackson Ouyang
GitHub: https://github.com/jouyang08/FlappybirdRL

This project implements a complete deep reinforcement learning system
using DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithms to train AI agents that master
the game of Flappy Bird. The system includes:

- Custom Pygame-based Flappy Bird environment
- DQN agent with experience replay and target networks
- Interactive training system with progress visualization
- Comprehensive documentation and mathematical foundations
